# sign-recognition

Classification of images corresponding to the different letters of the sign language alphabet. My
 first deep learning project!
Implemented with Python Tensorflow / Keras.

note: I keep this project as a souvenir because it was my very first deep learning project, which is basic and contains some errors: it seems obvious that this one should not be used in order to assess my skills, which have evolved well since.
